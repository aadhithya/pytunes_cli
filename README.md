# pytunes_cli
A simple Command Line script to control iTunes. 

The project uses a python wrapper class to control iTunes using AppleScript code with the awesome [py-applescript](https://github.com/rdhyee/py-applescript.git) library.

* Resume: `python itunes_cli.py -r`
* Stop: `python itunes_cli.py -st`

## Limitations

Apple being Apple have quite the restrictions in place here. This gives rise to the following limitations:
* The scripts only works for music in your library. This means **NO APPLE MUSIC SUPPORT** ðŸ˜«
* The script to play an album throws an 'Access Denied' Error eventhough the album is in the library. I don't know why yet.
